title: The Stories
subtitle: We Tell Ourselves
para: As research software engineers, or maybe people in general, we often reflect on our lives and remember a path of going from point A to point B. However, in the subtext of these journeys are personal stories -- stories that we tell ourselves. They unfortunately tend to be negative, because we are our biggest critics. Also unfortunately, these stories have direct influences on our thinking and subsequent behavior. To some degree, we have the power to change our environments, and thus the stories that we tell ourselves. We also have the power to choose how to react - meaning when we tell ourselves a negative story, we recognize it and tell ourselves a different story. This project is an effort to do just that. We will identify stories, reflect on why we might tell them, and then strategies for changing them. Changing them not only has implications for ourselves, but for our larger community
